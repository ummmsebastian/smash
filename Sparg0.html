    <h1>Sparg0 Background</h1>
    <p>Sparg0 is an Ultimate Cloud player from Tijuana, Mexico. He is considered the best Cloud player in the world, and was the best Aegis player in the world before using them as a secondary, as well as one of the best players in the world following the end of the online era, being widely considered the second best player in the world after MkLeo for 2021 and the first half of 2022. He is one of the most well-known prodigies in Smash, competing with and even taking sets off of top professionals at the age of 13. This, along with his heavy usage of sword characters, has given him comparisons to MkLeo's Smash 4 career. He is one of the youngest Ultimate players to win his first major alongside acola, winning Smash Ultimate Summit 4 at the age of 16. Sparg0 is currently ranked 1st on both the Wi-Fi Warrior Rank v7 and the Tijuana Power Rankings, 2nd on the Mexican Ultimate Power Rankings, OrionRank Mid-Year 2022 and the PGRU v3; he was also formerly ranked 2nd on the SoCal Ultimate Power Rankings.
